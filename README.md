# Torchy
Built from scratch neural network library using only Numpy and PyTorch as reference to 

## Implemented
1. Dense Layer (Linear)
2. ReLU
3. SGD
4. Cross-entropy Loss

## TO DO (Until 10th august)
1. BatchNorm1d, BatchNorm2d
2. Rebalance weights and biases initialization (currently inits as normal distribution from 0 to 1)
3. Convolution Layer (+padding, stride)
4. Activation functions (tanh, leaky relu)
